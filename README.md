# Pixiji back-end

This project is the current back-end of the Pixiji website, which you can also [find in my github account](https://github.com/ludivineConstanti/pixiji-gatsby).

The ⚡⚡⚡ mdDocumentation folder ⚡⚡⚡ contains some observations made during the project (bugs, research...). Other observations are made in the code itself as comment.
